React Basic Practice

Create a new branch under your name on the newest release tag.
Feel free to commit to your own branch(local/origin), but DO NOT merge your branch to main.

Layout and styles are free of requirements, this practice focuses on react only.
You may use CRA (Create React App) for this tutorial
Please use React classes not hooks
A demo video file is provided for reference only, NOT required to be the same.
